### Homepage

![wireframe of home page](wireframes/homepage-wireframe.jpg)

The homepage will serve to introduce the user to my professional identity, visual brand, and pique the interest of the user with attractive yet simple and efficient style.

Header: The version of the header on the homepage will be expanded. It will have a decorative background photo appropriate for being behind logo and text. The logo will represent my name/professional brand. My name will appear at the top along with an identity slogan quickly introducing users to my professional identity.

Navigation menu: Because the menu items will populate the main content of the page, the navigation menu will not appear in full. However, a hamburger menu option will appear in an expected place in the header to allow users to elect to see the navigation menu.

Main content: The main content of the homepage will consist of links to the menu items with descriptions of what can be found on those pages and some sort of decorative icon or graphic to represent the content of the page in an attractive way. Each section will have the same format and users will navigate the sections by scrolling.

Footer: The footer will remain consistent across the site and will contain icons for contact methods, each of which will be spelled out with a tooltip. For example, the tooltip when the user is hovering over the email icon will read "Send Jessica an email" or something along those lines.
